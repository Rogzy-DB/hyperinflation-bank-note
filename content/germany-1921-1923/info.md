# The German Hyperinflation (1921-1923)

## Overview

The German hyperinflation of 1921-1923 remains one of the most dramatic economic collapses in modern history. At its peak in November 1923, prices were doubling every **3.7 days**, and one US dollar was worth an almost incomprehensible **4.2 trillion marks**.

## The Perfect Storm

### War Debt and Reparations
Germany emerged from World War I with massive debts. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) imposed crushing reparations of 132 billion gold marks - a sum many economists considered impossible to pay.

### The Printing Press Solution
Rather than raise taxes or cut spending, the German government chose to print money. The Reichsbank's printing presses ran day and night, and by 1923, they employed **133 private printing firms** to keep up with demand.

### The Ruhr Occupation
When Germany defaulted on reparations in January 1923, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr industrial region. German workers responded with passive resistance, which the government supported by printing even more money to pay their wages.

## Life During Hyperinflation

### Daily Absurdities
- Workers were paid **twice daily** and rushed to spend their wages before they lost value
- A loaf of bread cost **200 billion marks** by November 1923
- People burned currency for heat - it was cheaper than buying firewood
- Wheelbarrows and suitcases replaced wallets

### Social Impact
The middle class was devastated. Lifetime savings became worthless overnight. A pension that could buy a house in 1921 couldn't buy a loaf of bread by 1923. This destruction of the middle class would have lasting political consequences.

## The End

In November 1923, the government introduced the **Rentenmark**, backed by mortgages on German land and industrial assets. One Rentenmark was worth **1 trillion old marks**. Remarkably, the German people accepted the new currency, and hyperinflation ended almost immediately.

## Legacy

The trauma of 1923 left deep scars on the German psyche. The fear of inflation influenced German monetary policy for generations and contributed to the strict anti-inflation mandate of today's Bundesbank and, by extension, the European Central Bank.
